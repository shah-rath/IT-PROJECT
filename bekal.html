                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        Bekal Fort is a medieval fort built by Shivappa Nayaka of Keladi in 1650 AD, at Bekal. It is the largest fort in Kerala, spreading over 40 acres (160,000 m2).
                        The fort appears to emerge from the sea. Almost three-quarters of its exterior is in contact with water. Bekal fort was not an administrative centre and does not include any palaces or mansions.

An important feature is the water-tank, magazine and the flight of steps leading to an observation tower built by Tipu Sultan.[1] Standing at the centre of the fort, this offers views of the coastline and the towns of Kanhangad, Pallikkara, Bekal, Mavval, Kottikkulam, and Uduma.

The fort's zigzag entrance and surrounding trenches reveal its defensive strategy. Holes on the outer walls are designed to defend the fort effectively from naval attacks. The upper holes meant for aiming at the farthest targets; lower holes below for striking as enemy nearer and the lowest holes to attacking enemy closest to the fort.[2]

                        <h4>How To Reach</h4>
                        <h3>BY Air</h3>
                        <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">TBekal has been deprived of an airport of its own. However, 
                            the domestic airport in Mangalore lies approximately 50 km away from Kasaragod district. 
                            The Bajpe Domestic Airport, Mangalore is situated about 247 km away from Bekal and provides
                             frequent flights to different parts of India. The Kozhikode International Airport lies closest 
                             to Bekal. Located 156 km away from Bekal, this airport offers flight options that connect to 
                             different parts of the world, including major cities in the Arab empire. Tourists can either 
                             take a cab from these airports to Bekal or use a train to commute to the nearest railway station</p>
                        <h3>BY Rail</h3>
                        <p>
                            Situated approximately 12 km apart from Bekal, Kanhangad and Kasaragod railway stations are 
                            located within close proximity. These prime railway stations facilitate smooth connectivity 
                            to several metropolitan cities of the country. Once at these stations, tourists can book a 
                            cab or taxi and travel to the main spot within Bekal. These cabs charge a decent rate of 250 
                            rupees for dropping visitors to and fro. The Pallikere and Kottikulam railway stations lie closer 
                            to Bekal. However, only trains that ply locally within Kerala stop at these stations.
                        </p>
                        <h3>BY Road</h3>
                        <p>Roadways leading to Bekal offer stunning panoramas along the way. 
                            State transport buses run by KSRTC ply regularly to Bekal from other 
                            main cities in Kerala. The closest bus stand to Bekal lies 12 km away in Kasaragod, 
                            offering ample connectivity options through the region. Tourists can either hire a taxi
                             or take up a cab to reach Bekal from this bus stand. Local modes of transport such as auto rickshaws,
                              buses, rental cars, and taxis ply through Bekal on a regular basis. They offer convenient and cheap
